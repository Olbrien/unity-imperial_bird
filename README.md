# Imperial Bird

Unity Android game released for the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Olbrieno.ImperialBird).

I wanted to make a really hard game that is also addictive.

It is a full released playable game with ads, music, sfx and menu.\

It has 3 original levels with difficulty ranging from very hard to really hard.\
You have to collect all yellow coins and reach the end without dying.\
It stores the number of deaths you had at that level.

You can upgrade your health by watching ads, whether by choice or by play time.

Effects made using the software Reaper and my guitar.\
Bird artwork is free of use made by Bevouliin.\
Rest of the artwork made by me using Gimp.

You can download the game from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Olbrieno.ImperialBird).

Can you beat the game?
